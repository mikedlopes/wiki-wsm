Ordered checklist for standing up SharePoint/M365 alongside this wiki. Mark items as you complete them in your runbook or PM tool.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | [Project folder convention](/company/resources/m365-wiki-implementation-tasks#task-1--project-folder-convention-git--wiki) | Done |

| 3 | Create libraries + metadata columns (`ProjectID`, `WikiArea`, `Lifecycle`, `DocType`) | Not started |
| 4 | Align Teams channels with libraries; pin wiki + SharePoint links | Not started |
| 5 | Backfill deep links on department pages (real SharePoint URLs) | Not started |

## Task 1 — Project folder convention (Git + wiki)

**Convention (canonical):**

| Item | Rule |
|------|------|
| **Real jobs** | One folder per job: `projects/<ProjectID>/` (e.g. `projects/TI-2026-045/`). `<ProjectID>` matches ERP / portfolio naming. |
| **No placeholder folder names** | Do not use a literal `[project-id]` directory in Git—brackets are documentation shorthand only. |
| **Blank starter** | Duplicate from `projects/template-project/` (starter page: [Project home template](/projects/template-project/project-home)). |
| **Worked example** | [TI-2026-045 — Downtown Office Renovation](/projects/TI-2026-045/downtown-office-renovation) shows a filled-in page using the same layout. |
| **Document library root** | `/<ProjectID>-<ClientShort>/` with **`00_`–`07_`** (permits, inspections, submittals, RFIs, calcs, etc.) **plus** Bid … Template Forms **plus** **Invoices**, **Material Listing**, **Purchase Orders**, and optional `_QuickLinks/` (see [template](/projects/template-project/project-home)). `<ClientShort>` is an agreed abbreviation; it **extends** the wiki folder name, does not replace it. |

**New job checklist:**

1. Copy `projects/template-project/` → `projects/<ProjectID>/`.
2. Rename `project-home.md` if you prefer one main file per job (e.g. `downtown-office-renovation.md`); update links.
3. Replace `{{PROJECT_ID}}`, `{{CLIENT_SHORT}}`, `{{PROJECT_TITLE}}`, and all `REPLACE_*` embed placeholders.
4. In **SharePoint** (or file share), create `/<ProjectID>-<ClientShort>/` and the full folder tree per the template (numbered + alphabetical + Invoices / Material Listing / Purchase Orders).
5. Add a row on [Projects dashboard](/projects/dashboard) and link from PM/field pages as needed.

**SharePoint:** Use the same `<ProjectID>` in library metadata; file tree root uses `<ProjectID>-<ClientShort>` (see architecture guidelines).

## Task 2 — SharePoint site count

Use the [architecture guidelines](/company/resources/sharepoint-m365-architecture-guidelines) site table; record your tenant’s final site names and URLs here when decided.

---

## Task 3 — Libraries + metadata

Implement **PRJ-Active** / **PRJ-Archive** (or one library + **Lifecycle**), **Bids**, **Standards**, **Templates**, accounting supporting libraries, and agreed columns.

---

## Task 4 — Teams alignment

Map Teams to workstreams; pin libraries and wiki anchors (Start here, dashboard, department overviews).

---

## Task 5 — Wiki deep links

Add “Files live in: …” (SharePoint URL) on high-traffic department and project pages.

---

## Task 6 — Invoices and receipts

Align with [Document retention](/departments/accounting/document-retention-and-audit-readiness) and ERP ownership; restrict **Invoices-Receipts** libraries.
